# AI D&D Master
## Description
We are big fans of D&D, but since we live in a very small city of Innopolis, we canâ€™t find a master to host our D&D sessions. In addition, we would like to have an ability to play with friends remotely. We decided to incorporate current AI advancements to automate the process of conducting a D&D session.

We plan to use LLMs for content generation and add reinforcement learning techniques to help the model with understanding the environment
